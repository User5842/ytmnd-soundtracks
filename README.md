# YTMND Soundtracks

If you grew up in the 2000s and consider yourself an internet kid, odds are, you stumbled across a website called [YTMND](https://ytmnd.com/).

I'll let Wikipedia [tell you about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND), but it was a game changer in pop culture and, for many of us, a crucial part of our upbringing.

Without question, one of the pillars of the website was its use of music and the published soundtracks that followed. It's hard to find the songs, and the closest thing we can get to is a [listing of the music in the different albums](https://wiki.ytmnd.com/YTMND_Soundtrack).

Fortunately, I have the entirety of the collection on my old iPod video, and through the next couple of weeks, I'll work on getting all of them uploaded for your listening pleasure.
